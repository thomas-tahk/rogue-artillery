# Current Development Status - July 20, 2025

## âœ… Completed Milestones

### Core Mechanics Working
- **Physics-based projectiles** - RigidBody2D with gravity, realistic arcing
- **Angle/power control** - Arrow keys for aim, spacebar hold for power charging
- **Visual feedback** - Power bar appears during charging
- **Terrain collision** - TileMapLayer with proper collision shapes
- **Bullet collision** - Fixed collision size, contact monitoring enabled
- **Basic sprites** - Replaced Godot icons with simple tank and bullet sprites
- **DESTRUCTIBLE TERRAIN** - Bullets create cross-shaped holes in terrain! ðŸŽ‰

### Technical Architecture Established
- **Scene structure**: Shooter.tscn (main) with instantiated Terrain.tscn
- **Physics**: RigidBody2D for bullets, TileMapLayer for terrain
- **Collision debugging**: Enabled visual collision shapes for troubleshooting
- **Signal system**: Bullets â†’ explosion signal â†’ terrain destruction working perfectly

## ðŸ”„ Current Focus: Polish & Expand

**Major milestone achieved!** Core artillery mechanics are solid. Ready to expand with features that make it feel like a complete game.

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate To-Do List

### High Priority
1. **Camera system** - Proper world positioning, follows projectiles during flight
2. **Angle indicator UI** - Gauge-style indicator attached to gun, visible only during player turns
3. **Turn system** - Basic player/enemy alternation
4. **Visual polish** - Explosion particles, screen shake

### Medium Priority  
1. **Enemy AI** - Simple aiming at player
2. **Weapon variety** - Different projectile types
3. **Health/damage system** - Unit destruction mechanics
4. **Win/lose conditions** - Battle end states

### Later
1. **Upgrade system** - Between-battle progression
2. **Roguelite structure** - Campaign map, meta progression
3. **Sound effects** - Shooting, explosions, UI feedback

## ðŸ¤” Current Decisions Pending

1. **Destructible terrain method**: Image-based vs polygon-based vs tile removal
2. **Camera behavior**: Static vs following projectiles vs manual control
3. **Turn system timing**: Immediate switch vs animation delays
4. **Enemy AI complexity**: Simple vs tactical vs varied personalities

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

1. **Positioning**: Terrain/tank positioning works in editor but not in play (camera system will fix)
2. **Bullet spawn**: Slight collision with tank on spawn (adjusting spawn offset helped)
3. **Performance**: No optimization done yet (not a concern until more complex systems)

## ðŸ“š Resources Bookmarked for Next Phase

### Destructible Terrain
- "Worms-style Destructible Terrain in Godot" by Rungeon
- Official Godot docs on Image manipulation
- Geometry2D class documentation for polygon methods

### Camera Systems
- "Camera Follow in Godot 4" tutorials
- Artillery game camera reference videos

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics for Current Phase

- [ ] Bullets create visible holes in terrain
- [ ] Collision updates properly after destruction  
- [ ] Basic explosion effect on impact
- [ ] No performance issues with destruction

**Target**: Complete destructible terrain by end of week
